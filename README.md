# Skip Silence
"Skip Silence" is a browser extension that allows you to automatically skip parts of a video that are silent.
It is highly inspired by CaryKH's [automatic on-the-fly video editing tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ8orIurGxw).
The extension works with most websites that use HTML5 `audio` and `video` elements (like YouTube).

## Demo

(Video used: Unedited part of <https://youtu.be/DQ8orIurGxw?t=234>)

## Installation
"Skip Silence" is available through the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/skip-silence/fhdmkhbefcbhakffdihhceaklaigdllh).
You can also install this extension on Chrome by downloading the source from GitHub and loading the unpacked, built extension through "chrome://extensions" as a "Temporary Add-On".

## Firefox
"Skip Silence" will only work on Firefox Beta 91+ due to [a bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1517199) that has been fixed in that version.

## Usage
When "Skip Silence" detects a compatible element on the current page, its icon in the menubar will be colored.

You can now click on this icon to reveal the settings popup.

You can now:
- Click the toggle button to enable and disable "Skip Silence" for the current page
- Change "Skip Silence"'s settings
- View the current volume using the VU meter
  - The VU Meter will be blue when on normal speed and green when currently in a silent part
  - The red line represents your current volume threshold

## Limitations
- Won't work on sites that use other methods to play video or audio (e.g. Spotify Web Player uses a special method to prevent songs from being downloaded)

## How does it work?
The extension attaches a JavaScript audio analyser to the current video or audio source and will speed up or slow down the video using the current volume of the audio.

## Development
